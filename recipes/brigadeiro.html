  <h2>The traditional Brazilian chocolate dessert</h2>
  <p>This is a simple dish, beloved by pretty much every brazilian in existence.</p>
  <p>The basic version is richly chocolatey, but the recipe is highly modifiable, granting you plenty of possibilities in base flavor, texture, and sweetness level.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>For this recipe, all you'll really need are three ingredients.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One can or box of condensed milk</li>
    <li>One box of heavy cream</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder to taste</li>
    <li>(Optional) A tablespoon of butter or margarine</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>The recipe is really easy, with a simple cooking technique. However, please be careful. Details below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Put all ingredients in a deep pan, including the butter/margarine if you so choose.</li>
    <li>Combine the ingredients. No need to mix them thoroughly yet.</li>
    <li>Turn on the heat to medium-low.</li>
    <li>Stir continuously until the mixture starts to boil.</li>
    <li>Bring heat to the minimum and continue stirring.</li>
    <li>Stop stirring and turn off the heat when the mixture reaches a smooth texture, which takes approximately 8 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Observation:</strong> The longer you boil the mixture, the thicker the end result will be. Use this information to create a dessert you can eat with a spoon, or to roll into little balls and decorate with sprinkles later.</p>
